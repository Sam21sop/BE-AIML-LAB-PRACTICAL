2. Implementing Feed-forward neural networks with Keras and TensorFlow.

        a. Import the necessary packages
   
        b. Load the training and testing data (MNIST/CIFAR10)

        c. Define the network architecture using Keras

        d. Train the model using SGD

        e. Evaluate the network

        f. Plot the training loss and accuracy


4. Build the Image classification model by dividing the model into the following fourstages:

      a. Loading and preprocessing the image data

      b. Defining the model’s architecture

      c. Training the model

      d. Estimating the model’s performance


6. Use Autoencoder to implement anomaly detection. Build the model by using the following:

      a. Import required libraries

      b. Upload/access the dataset

      c. The encoder converts it into a latent representation

      d. Decoder networks convert it back to the original input

      e. Compile the models with Optimizer, Loss, and Evaluation Metrics


8. Implement the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) Model. Stages can be:

      a. Data preparation

      b. Generate training data

      c. Train model

      d. Output


10. Object detection using Transfer Learning of CNN architectures

      a. Load in a pre-trained CNN model trained on a large dataset

      b. Freeze parameters(weights) in the model’s lower convolutional layers

      c. Add a custom classifier with several layers of trainable parameters to model

      d. Train classifier layers on training data available for the task

      e. Fine-tune hyperparameters and unfreeze more layers as needed
